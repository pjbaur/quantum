# Enhancement Backlog (2026-08-27)

Forward-looking work items, distinct from the closed critical-review and
quality-assessment queues. Sources: the capability ladder in
`docs/example-ideas.md`, residuals documented in
`specs/architecture/code_quality_assessment.md`, and code inspection.

## Capability Gaps

These block the example-ideas trio (CHSH, teleportation, VQE-toy) and the
later ladder stages (QPE, QAOA, noise-aware demos).

- [x] 1. **Shot sampling API** — `Measure(qubitIndex)` measures one qubit at
  a time and collapses the state. Add a non-destructive
  `Sample(state, shots, rng)` helper returning a bitstring histogram.
  Unlocks CHSH, demo output, and expectation estimation. Lowest effort,
  highest unlock.
  > **Done (2026-08-27)**: `quantum.Sample(s, shots, rng)` in
  > `quantum/sample.go` — cumulative-distribution walk over
  > `Amplitude(i)`, binary search per draw, keys formatted like
  > `FormatStateView` (`%0*b`, qubit 0 = least significant bit).
  > Non-destructive, injectable randomness (nil rng = global default),
  > typed errors `InvalidShotCountError` and `UnnormalizedStateError`
  > (NaN-safe). Tests in `quantum/sample_test.go` and
  > `quantum/sample_backends_test.go` (dense + sparse agreement,
  > non-destructiveness, deterministic stub draws, zero-probability-bucket
  > skip). Sparse backends are walked in full — O(2^n) — documented in the
  > doc comment; a nonzero-only path would need a backend-side override.
- [ ] 2. **Expectation values** — helpers for ⟨ψ|P|ψ⟩ over Pauli strings and
  basis-change measurement (X/Y-basis via pre-rotation). Blocks CHSH
  correlation, VQE, QAOA.
- [ ] 3. **Classical control / conditional gates** — mid-circuit `Measure`
  collapses correctly, but there is no classical register and no
  "if bit then gate". Blocks teleportation feed-forward, error correction,
  adaptive algorithms.
- [ ] 4. **Parameter rebinding** — `NewRx(theta)` bakes the matrix at
  construction, so variational outer loops must rebuild the whole circuit
  per iteration. Provide symbolic parameters or a cheap rebuild path.
- [ ] 5. **State fidelity** — an F(|ψ⟩,|φ⟩) helper. Blocks teleportation
  verification; useful as a cross-backend assertion in tests.
- [ ] 6. **QFT / inverse QFT** — absent. Blocks phase estimation.
  `NewControlled` already provides controlled-U powers, so QFT is the
  missing half.

## Backend Work

- [ ] 7. **Generic k-qubit sparse gates** — sparse backend is capped at
  2-qubit gates by explicit contract. Lifting the cap makes sparse a true
  drop-in; the `BackendCapabilities` machinery can enforce either policy.
- [ ] 8. **Dedupe backend math residuals** — `SetAmplitude(s)` validation
  and rollback, `isNormalized`/`probabilitySum`, and the 2×2/combo mixing
  loops remain near-verbatim in dense and sparse backends (guarded by the
  dense-vs-sparse equivalence fuzz).
- [ ] 9. **Density backend as `QuantumState`** — ADR-0007 deliberately
  scopes `internal/density` to noise-and-analysis. Revisit trigger: a
  concrete consumer needing full circuits on density matrices (for example
  trajectory-style noisy execution).

## Quality / Infrastructure

- [ ] 10. **Extended fuzzing** — CI runs fuzz targets over seed corpora
  only. Commit grown corpora or add a periodic long `-fuzz` job.
- [ ] 11. **Coverage floor** — CI threshold is 40.0, actual coverage 48.0.
  Raise the threshold to ~45 to lock in gains.
- [ ] 12. **`.gitignore` fix** — `.claude/settings.local.json` is tracked
  and not ignored; it should be gitignored and untracked.

## Suggested Order

1 and 2 and 5 first — small, additive, unlock the CHSH demo end to end.
Then 3 for teleportation. Items 4 and 6 are larger; do them when VQE or
QPE is actually wanted.
